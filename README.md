# FAQ

###  What was UNIX?

The greatest operating system ever invented you never knew whose genius design now enables everything great you love. [More...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix)

### What is UNIX today?

A set of core [computer science principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and open source software projects that link dozens of operating systems to form the basis of modern computing, from mobile devices in your pocket to mainframes that power e-commerce giants.

### Disambiguation: UNIX v. UNIX-Like v. Linux

#### Commercial UNIX

UNIX was originally an operating system developed at AT&T's Bell Labs.Â® It has evolved today into a set of operating systems standards, called [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)Â® overseen by the (IEEEÂ®)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX], and a certification that can be obtained by companies for their commercial operating systems, through a process administrated by (The Open GroupÂ®)[https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/]. Among the commercial are massive mainframe operating systems like IBMÂ®'s AIXÂ® as well AppleÂ®'s macOSÂ® desktop operating for their MacBookÂ® and iMacÂ® lineup.

#### UNIX Principles

These core set of standards, set forth by IEEE and The Open Group, allows software to be easily transferred and re-compiled on different operating systems across different hardware. It enables the rapid spread and development of new technology. These principles are generally known as UNIX philosophy. The Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible software on a common set of libraries that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. 

#### UNIX Direct Descendants

UNIX also encompasses operating systems that are direct descendants of the original AT&T UNIX codebase but have since [re-implemented AT&T code with code under open source licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution). The most prominent of which the family of BSDs: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD, and their derivatives. These are not UNIX certified, they are technically UNIX-like, but share a unique direct link back to AT&T UNIX and newcomers like RedoxOS do not.

#### UNIX-Like Operating Systems

For a variety of historical and legal reasons, there has also been a massive explosion of *UNIX-like* operating systems. MINIX, for example, was created as a UNIX-like teaching operating system by Prof. Andrew S. Tanenbaum. Linux was created because Linus Torvalds, a college student, [wanted to run a UNIX-like operating system](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html) on his own Intel PC. Linux has since gone on to be come the most popular Unix-like operating system. Twenty years later, when GoogleÂ® needed a kernel for their new mobile operating system, they borrowed one from Linux. Unix-like operating systems implement some degree of the POSIX standards but do not seek official UNIX certification.
